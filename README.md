# Deck of Cards
## Overview

This is a simple program that implements a deck of cards class. The main function is a sample draw poker game used for testing (and fun)! 

The class implements a shuffle function which returns a new deck in a randomized order, and a dealOneCard function which removes one card from the "top" of the deck, returning it. 

## Instructions for Draw Poker

You will be given 5 cards. You will then be asked which cards you want to keep. These are selected by entering any numbers 1-5, i.e. 125. These inputs are not validated much, as this was a test case.  Then you will be dealt cards to fill your hand up to 5 again, then your final hand will be displayed.
